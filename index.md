## A Tree-Based Model for Activity Based Travel Models and Feature Selection

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lkuwahara/DSC180B.github.io-B05/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Introduction

In a previous study, Deloitte Consulting LLP developed a method of creating city simulations through cellular location and geospatial data. Using these simulations of human activity and traffic patterns, better decisions can be made regarding modes of transportation or road construction. However, the current commonly used method of estimating transportation mode choice is a utility model that involves many features and coefficients that may not necessarily be important but still make the model more complex. Our goal is to use a tree-based approach - in particular, XGBoost - to identify just the features that are important for determining mode choice so that we can create a model that is simpler, robust, and easily deployable. By the end of the quarter, we plan to have a working model to predict mode choice and a written paper to report our results and analyses.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lkuwahara/DSC180B.github.io-B05/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
